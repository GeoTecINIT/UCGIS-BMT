## EO4GEO - BoK Matching Tool (BMT)

The [BoK Matching Tool (BMT)](https://eo4geo-bmt.web.app) allows to compare EO4GEO BoK-annotated resources with respect to knowledge and skills and visually discover (dis)similarities. Resources can be ranked according to best/worst match and detailed statistics can be seen for every individual match. BoK-annotated resources understood by BMT are any content created by any of the other tools in the EO4GEO tools ecosystem: an educational offer (CDT), a job offer (JOT), an occupational profile (OPT) or an annotated PDF file (BAT). 

#### Authors
The EO4GEO BoK tools are developed by the [Geospatial Technologies Research Group](http://geotec.uji.es/) (GEOTEC) from the University Jaume I, Castellón (Spain) and are Licensed under GNU GPLv3.
